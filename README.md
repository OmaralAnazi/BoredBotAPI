# BoredBot

## Description
"BoredBot" is a playful and useful web application developed as part of the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program. This guided project taps into an API to generate random activities for users looking to break free from boredom. It's an excellent introduction to working with APIs, servers, clients, and the request/response cycle.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Interfaced with external APIs to fetch data for users.
- Parsed and handled JSON data structures in JavaScript.
- Implemented `fetch` syntax to make asynchronous API requests.
- Explored the server-client relationship and the request/response lifecycle.

## Setup
Clone the repository, open `index.html` in a web browser, and interact with BoredBot to find an activity to do.
